        <p class="Para-1">
            An ice sheet is a mass of glacial land ice extending more than 50,000 square kilometers (20,000 square
            miles). The two ice sheets on Earth today cover most of Greenland and Antarctica.Together, the Antarctic and
            Greenland ice sheets contain more than 99 percent of the freshwater ice on Earth. </p><br>

        <p><b>"Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than a third of the world’s remaining
                glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in
                the Arctic is already gone."</b></p> <br>

        <p>The mass of ice in the Greenland Ice Sheet has begun to decline. From 1979 to 2006, summer melt on the ice
            sheet increased by 30 percent, reaching a new record in 2007. Most of Antarctica has yet to see dramatic
            warming. Antarctic Ice Sheet is also losing mass, probably because of warmer water deep in the ocean near
            the Antarctic coast.</p>

        <p class="Para-1">Scientists theorize that the next mass extinction on earth could occur as soon as 2050,
            according to National Geographic News. Plant and animal species become extinct for different reasons, both
            natural and man-made.</p> <br>

        <p><b>"Since 1964, when the IUCN established a “red list” of threatened species and began compiling data
                gathered worldwide, the list has become the preeminent global database of endangered life and an
                essential tool for conservation policy."</b></p><br>

        <p>Most of the animals shown here are among the more than 28,000 species of animals and plants that the
            International Union for Conservation of Nature says are threatened with extinction. Habitat loss—driven
            primarily by human expansion as we develop land for housing, agriculture, and commerce—is the biggest threat
            facing most animal species, followed by hunting and fishing. </p>
